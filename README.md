## Troubleshooting
- If the form does not display correctly, ensure that all files ([`index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcse4%2Fnm%20form%2Findex.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%220fdb6200-2bae-4f8f-aed5-37f06d797b4e%22%5D "c:\Users\cse4\nm form\index.html"), [`style.css`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcse4%2Fnm%20form%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%220fdb6200-2bae-4f8f-aed5-37f06d797b4e%22%5D "c:\Users\cse4\nm form\style.css"), [`script.js`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fcse4%2Fnm%20form%2Fscript.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%220fdb6200-2bae-4f8f-aed5-37f06d797b4e%22%5D "c:\Users\cse4\nm form\script.js")) are in the same directory.
- If validation does not work, check the browser console for JavaScript errors (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open developer tools).
